Creating a detailed specification for a Library Management System (LMS) project involves outlining its functionalities, user roles, interactions, data entities, and technical requirements. Here's a structured approach to writing the specification:

## Project Specification: Library Management System (LMS)

### 1. Introduction

The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to automate and streamline the operations of a library, facilitating efficient management of books, users, transactions, notifications, and reporting.

### 2. Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 User Management

- **Admin**
  - Can add, edit, and delete librarians and members.
  - Access to all functionalities of the system.
  
- **Librarian**
  - Can manage books (add, edit, delete).
  - Handle borrowing and returning books by members.
  - View transaction history.
  
- **Member**
  - Can borrow and return books.
  - Receive notifications about due dates and fines.

#### 2.2 Book Management

- Add new books with details (title, author, ISBN, etc.).
- Edit existing book details.
- Delete books from the system.

#### 2.3 Transaction Management

- **Borrowing**
  - Members can borrow books, which updates book availability and due dates.
  - Limits on the number of books a member can borrow.
  
- **Returning**
  - Members return books, triggering fine calculation for overdue items.
  - Books are marked as returned, updating availability status.

#### 2.4 Notification System

- **Email Notifications**
  - Members receive emails for overdue reminders, transaction confirmations.
  
- **SMS Notifications**
  - Optionally, members can receive SMS notifications.

#### 2.5 Logging and Reporting

- **Logging**
  - System logs events such as book additions, user actions, and notifications.
  
- **Reports**
  - Generate reports on:
    - Book inventory.
    - User transactions.
    - Fines collected.
    - Most borrowed books.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
  - System should handle simultaneous transactions efficiently.
  
- **Security**
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - Data encryption for sensitive information (e.g., passwords).
  
- **Scalability**
  - Design should allow for scaling as the library grows.
  
- **Maintainability**
  - Codebase should be modular and well-documented.
  - Easily extendable for future enhancements.

### 4. Data Entities

- **User**
  - Admin, Librarian, Member.
  
- **Book**
  - Title, Author, ISBN, Availability, etc.
  
- **Transaction**
  - Borrowing, Returning, Due Dates, Fines.
  
- **Notification**
  - Email, SMS.

### 5. Architecture and Technologies

- **Language**: C++11/C++14
- **Concurrency**: Thread management for simultaneous transactions.
- **Data Storage**: File-based or database (SQLite, MySQL) for persistent storage.
- **GUI**: Optional graphical interface using Qt or similar framework.

### 6. User Interface

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Manage users, view system statistics.
  
- **Librarian Interface**
  - Book management, transaction handling.
  
- **Member Portal**
  - Borrow, return books, view fines.

### 7. Deployment

- Deployable on Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms.
- Installation instructions and dependencies.

### 8. Testing

- Unit tests for critical functionalities.
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios.
- User acceptance testing with stakeholders.

### 9. Assumptions and Constraints

- Assumes users have basic computer literacy.
- Constraints on hardware and network infrastructure.

### 10. Glossary

- **LMS**: Library Management System.
- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface.
- **ISBN**: International Standard Book Number.

### 11. Appendix

- Additional diagrams (e.g., Use Case Diagram, Class Diagram).
- References and resources.
